the hero of our connected world: application programming interface (API)
an API is a messenger that takes a request and tells the system what you want to do and then returns the response back to you.
think of an API as an waiter on a restaurant, imagine you're sitting at a table with a menu of choices you can order from and the kitchen is the part of the system which will prepare your order, what missing is the critical link that gets your order to the kitchen and deliver your food to the table back, that's where the waiter or the API comes in.
the waiter is the messenger that takes your request or order to the system the kitchen and tells it what to do and then delivers the response back to you.

example:
searching for airline classes online, you have a menu to choose from, departure city, date, return city, date and other variables, in order to book your flight, you interact with airlines website to access the airline database to see if you can book any flight and what the price might be.
but what if you are not using an airline website which has direct access to the information? what if you are using an online travel service that aggregate information from many different airlines? the travel service interacts with airlines API. the API is the interface that like our helpful waiter that get ask by the travel service to get information from the airline systems over the internet to book sits, to choose meal preferences or baggage options, it also then takes the airline responses and pass it to travel service and shows it to you.

the same goes for all interactions within applications, data and devices.
they all have APIs that creates connectivity.
so API is just our waiters that running back and forth within applications, databases and devices to deliver the data and create connectivity that puts the world on our fingertips.
