the hero of our connected world: application programming interface (API)
an API is a messenger that takes a request and tells the system what you want to do and then returns the response back to you.
think of an API as an waiter on a restaurant, imagine you're sitting at a table with a menu of choices you can order from and the kitchen is the part of the system which will prepare your order, what missing is the critical link that gets your order to the kitchen and deliver your food to the table back, that's where the waiter or the API comes in.
the waiter is the messenger that takes your request or order to the system the kitchen and tells it what to do and then delivers the response back to you.

example:
searching for airline classes online, you have a menu to choose from, departure city, date, return city, date and other variables, in order to book your flight, you interact with airlines website to access the airline database to see if you can book any flight and what the price might be.
but what if you are not using an airline website which has direct access to the information? what if you are using an online travel service that aggregate information from many different airlines? the travel service interacts with airlines API. the API is the interface that like our helpful waiter that get ask by the travel service to get information from the airline systems over the internet to book sits, to choose meal preferences or baggage options, it also then takes the airline responses and pass it to travel service and shows it to you.

the same goes for all interactions within applications, data and devices.
they all have APIs that creates connectivity.
so API is just our waiters that running back and forth within applications, databases and devices to deliver the data and create connectivity that puts the world on our fingertips.

# LLM

Large language models (LLMs) are machine learning models that can comprehend and generate human language text.
imagine a parrot when you talk around it, after some times it learns and starts to complete your sentences, how does it do that?
the parrot use statistical probability and randomness, it's how a language model work.
for example, Grammarly is an language model, it just predicts the sentences, email auto completer, or your phone auto correct, hmm?
so what is an Large Language Model?
it's just trained on a very huge volume of data, inside this is a neural network containing thousands and thousands of parameters.
chat GPT is an LLM.
LLM uses Reinforcement Learning with Humans Feedback.
you know this models don't have emotions or a sense of consciousness, they just works purely on based on data they've been trained on.

more professional:
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of deep learning algorithm that can understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs operate by leveraging deep neural networks, particularly transformer architectures, to process large amounts of sequential data like text input. These models are pre-trained on vast datasets and can perform a variety of tasks such as language translation, text generation, and question answering.

we have a complete article [here](https://bluetickconsultants.medium.com/what-is-llm-the-process-of-building-your-own-large-language-models-499aa888d154) introducing LLM and transformers mechanisms.
but for now, it's enough.

# GPT

The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) API, developed by OpenAI, provides powerful natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, enabling a wide range of applications. Here's an overview of its usage, applications, and potential projects you can create with it:

### Usage of GPT API

The GPT API allows developers to integrate advanced language models into their applications, providing the ability to generate human-like text, understand and respond to queries, and perform various NLP tasks. The API typically works through HTTP requests, where you send a prompt (a piece of text) to the API, and it returns a generated response based on the model's training.

### Applications of GPT API

1. **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**:
   - Develop conversational agents that can engage in human-like interactions, answer questions, and provide support.

2. **Content Generation**:
   - Generate articles, blog posts, stories, and social media content.
   - Assist in creative writing, providing suggestions, and completing texts.

3. **Customer Support**:
   - Automate customer service responses, handle FAQs, and provide instant support.

4. **Language Translation**:
   - Translate text between different languages with high accuracy.

5. **Text Summarization**:
   - Summarize long articles, documents, and reports into concise summaries.

6. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Analyze the sentiment of a given text, determining whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.

7. **Code Generation and Assistance**:
   - Help developers by generating code snippets, debugging code, and providing explanations.

8. **Educational Tools**:
   - Create tutoring systems, language learning apps, and educational content generators.

9. **Personalized Recommendations**:
   - Provide personalized suggestions for products, content, and more based on user input.

10. **Data Extraction**:
    - Extract structured information from unstructured text, such as dates, names, and other entities.

### Potential Projects with GPT API

1. **AI Writing Assistant**:
   - A tool that helps writers by providing ideas, completing sentences, and suggesting improvements.

2. **Intelligent FAQ Bot**:
   - A chatbot that can answer frequently asked questions for a business or website.

3. **Creative Story Generator**:
   - An app that generates creative stories based on user-provided prompts and themes.

9. **Virtual Personal Shopper**:
   - A chatbot that provides fashion and product recommendations based on user preferences.

10. **Interactive Storytelling App**:
    - An app where users can interact with and influence the direction of a story through their inputs.

### Getting Started

well first you need an openai account.
then you go in your account, api key part and click on + to get your new one.
then it's better to create an .env file and store the api there like:

OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

here now we follow the org [document](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)
the main library is openai.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "write a haiku about ai"}
    ]
)
```

we integrate the API into our application by making HTTP requests and handling the responses, then experiment with different prompts and settings to tailor the responses to your specific use case.

### Fine-tune
Fine-tuning is currently available for the following models: `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` (recommended), `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`, `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613`, `babbage-002`, `davinci-002`, `gpt-4-0613` (experimental), and `gpt-4o-2024-05-13`.

You can also fine-tune a fine-tuned model which is useful if you acquire additional data and don't want to repeat the previous training steps.
We expect `gpt-4o-mini` to be the right model for most users in terms of performance, cost, and ease of use.

Some common use cases where fine-tuning can improve results:
- Setting the style, tone, format, or other qualitative aspects
- Improving reliability at producing a desired output
- Correcting failures to follow complex prompts
- Handling many edge cases in specific ways
- Performing a new skill or task that’s hard to articulate in a prompt

afterwards if you got fine-tuning is the right answer for you, you need to prepare a dataset.

### Response Limit
1. **Token Limit**: The GPT API typically limits responses based on the number of tokens rather than words. A token can be as short as one character or as long as one word, depending on the language.
    - For example, GPT-3.5 models usually have a maximum token limit of around 4096 tokens per request (including both input and output tokens).
    - For GPT-4, the token limit may be higher, around 8000 tokens, depending on the specific variant and subscription.

### Timeout
1. **Response Time**: The response time depends on the complexity of the query and the server load. It typically ranges from a few hundred milliseconds to a couple of seconds.
    - For regular API calls, if the request takes too long, it may time out. Timeouts can be configured in some cases, but typically they are set to a few seconds.

### Words Per Response
1. **Word Count**: Given the token limit, the number of words in a response can vary. On average, 1000 tokens are roughly equivalent to 750 words in English.
    - If the maximum token limit is 4096, then the response can contain approximately 3000 words, considering both the input and the output.
    - The exact number of words can be lower or higher depending on the specific language and nature of the text.

### Practical Usage
- **Chunking Requests**: For larger tasks, such as generating long documents, you may need to chunk your requests into multiple API calls, managing the context and state between calls.
- **Streaming Responses**: Some implementations and versions of the API may support streaming responses, which can help in handling longer outputs by receiving chunks of data progressively.

### Best Practices
1. **Optimizing Prompts**: Keep your prompts concise and focused to stay within token limits and get more relevant responses.
2. **Handling Limits**: Implement logic in your application to handle token limits and timeouts gracefully. This could include breaking down tasks or retrying with modified inputs.
3. **Monitoring Usage**: Monitor your API usage to ensure you stay within the rate limits and quotas provided by your subscription plan.

# Claude

#### getting started with claude:

1. **Sign up for an Anthropic account**

2. **Obtain an API key** 
- `CLAUDE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"`
- create an .env file to save the key

1. **Install the necessary library or SDK**
- `pip install anthropic`
- [python repo](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python)

2. **Set up authentication**
- All requests to the Anthropic API must include an `x-api-key` header with your API key. If you are using the Client SDKs, you will set the API when constructing a client, and then the SDK will send the header on your behalf with every request. If integrating directly with the API, you’ll need to send this header yourself.
```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages --header "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" ...
```

5. **Start making API calls**

### Tips

- Adjusting parameters like temperature, top_p, and max_tokens
- Using system prompts or specific instructions to guide Claude's behavior
- Fine-tuning (if available) for specific use cases
- The claude has google sheets [extension](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/claude%5Ffor%5Fsheets/909417792257) but you can't use it with free api plan
- numberland sells out api accounts for 450 T

### Rate Limits
![Pasted image 20240728133822](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/014769cf-455a-49e4-abc5-d4a6d5fff02d)

 If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a [429 error](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/errors).

### Response Headers
The API response includes headers that show you the rate limit enforced, current usage, and when the limit will be reset.
![Pasted image 20240728140405](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84cf4c86-4298-4cc4-9def-21572c9ddadf)


## Async usage

Simply import `AsyncAnthropic` instead of `Anthropic` and use `await` with each API call:

```python
import os
import asyncio
from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic

client = AsyncAnthropic(
    # This is the default and can be omitted
    api_key=os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
)


async def main() -> None:
    message = await client.messages.create(
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hello, Claude",
            }
        ],
        model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    )
    print(message.content)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Functionality between the synchronous and asynchronous clients is otherwise identical.
### Timeouts

By default requests time out after 10 minutes. You can configure this with a `timeout` option, which accepts a float or an [`httpx.Timeout`](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#fine-tuning-the-configuration) object:

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

# Configure the default for all requests:
client = Anthropic(
    # 20 seconds (default is 10 minutes)
    timeout=20.0,
)

# More granular control:
client = Anthropic(
    timeout=httpx.Timeout(60.0, read=5.0, write=10.0, connect=2.0),
)

# Override per-request:
client.with_options(timeout=5.0).messages.create(
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hello, Claude",
        }
    ],
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
)
```

On timeout, an `APITimeoutError` is thrown.
Note that requests that time out are [retried twice by default](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#retries).

# sheet

The [Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/create) API is a RESTful interface that lets you read and modify a spreadsheet's data. The most common uses of this API include the following tasks:

- Create spreadsheets
- Read and write spreadsheet cell values
- Update spreadsheet formatting
- Manage Connected Sheets

[_Spreadsheet_](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets)
The primary object in Google Sheets that can contain multiple sheets, each with structured information contained in cells. A [Spreadsheet resource](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets) represents every spreadsheet and has a unique [`spreadsheetId`](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets) value, containing letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores. You can find the spreadsheet ID in a Google Sheets URL:
`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheetId/edit#gid=0`

[_Sheet_](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/sheets)
A page or tab within a spreadsheet. A [Sheet resource](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/sheets) represents each sheet and has a unique title and numeric [`sheetId`](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/sheets) value. You can find the sheet ID in a Google Sheets URL:
`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/aBC-123_xYz/edit#gid=sheetId`

[_Cell_](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/cells)
An individual field of text or data within a sheet. Cells are arranged in rows and columns, and can be grouped as a range of cells. A [CellData resource](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/cells) represents each cell, but it doesn't have a unique ID value. Instead, row and column coordinates identify the cells.

### Setting Up Google Sheets API

# meet

**usages:**
Meeting spaces
Conferences 
Participants & Artifacts
you can literally do all meetings management within

all details are pointed out [here](https://developers.google.com/meet/api/guides/overview)
![join-google-meet-using-third-party-chat-app-animated-gif-850-px-wide](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d7766d9-313b-4d41-94a5-7d224c8d2a64)



you can create, update and end a meeting

**creating a meeting space:**
```python
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a  
# code template only.  
# It will require modifications to work:  
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.  
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service  
#   client as shown in:  
#   https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/client_options.html  
from google.apps import meet_v2  
  
async def sample_create_space():    # Create a client    
client = meet_v2.SpacesServiceAsyncClient()    # Initialize request argument(s) 
request = meet_v2.CreateSpaceRequest(    )    # Make the request    
response = await client.create_space(request=request)    # Handle the response 
print(response)
```


_Artifact_

A file generated by Meet in response to a _conference_, such as [recordings](https://developers.google.com/meet/api/reference/rest/v2/conferenceRecords.recordings) and [transcripts](https://developers.google.com/meet/api/reference/rest/v2/conferenceRecords.transcripts). Usually an artifact is ready to be fetched soon after a conference ends.

_Calendar event_

An event in Google Calendar with multiple attendees, typically created by a _meeting organizer_, containing the joining info of a meeting. Meet might be the _conference_ solution for the event.

_Call_

A session using Meet, or to notify others that a call is beginning or in progress and allow them to immediately join.

_Conference_

A conference is an instance of a _call_ within a _meeting space_. Users typically consider this scenario a single meeting.

_Co-host_

A person in a _call_ who has been granted host-management privileges by a _host_, except the ability to remove the original host.

_Host_

The person who created a _call_ (the _meeting organizer_) or the person who controls the call. Note that a meeting organizer can organize the meeting but not be present when it takes place. A host can also delegate host privileges to a _co-host_.

_Meeting code_

A typeable, unique 10-character string for a _meeting space_ used within the _meeting URI_ of a meeting space. It's non-case sensitive. For example, `abc-mnop-xyz`. The maximum length is 128 characters.

Meeting codes shouldn't be stored long term as they can become dissociated from a meeting space and can be reused for different meeting spaces in the future. Generally, meeting codes expire 365 days after last use. For more information, see [Learn about meeting codes in Google Meet](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/10710509).

_Meeting name_

A unique server-generated ID used to identify a _meeting space_. It's case sensitive. For example, `jQCFfuBOdN5z`. The meeting ID is returned in the `name` field of a [`spaces`](https://developers.google.com/meet/api/reference/rest/v2/spaces) resource.

_Meeting organizer_

The user that created the _meeting space_. This user can also be considered the meeting owner. They might not be present during the _call_ or be the meeting _host_. There can only be one meeting organizer.

_Meeting space_

A virtual place or a persistent object (such as a meeting room) where a _conference_ is held. Only one active conference can be held in one space at any time. A meeting space also helps users meet and find shared resources.

_Meeting URI_

A clickable URL that starts or joins a user to a _call_. Each call has a unique URL consisting of `https://meet.google.com/` followed by the _meeting code_. For example, `https://meet.google.com/abc-mnop-xyz`.

_Participant_

A person joined to a _call_ or that uses [Companion mode](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/11295507), watching as a viewer, or a room device connected to a call. There's one [`conferenceRecords.participants`](https://developers.google.com/meet/api/reference/rest/v2/conferenceRecords.participants) resource for each person. When a participant joins the _conference_, a unique ID is assigned.

_Participant session_

A unique session ID created for each participant-device pair that joins a _call_. There's one [`conferenceRecords.participants.participantSessions`](https://developers.google.com/meet/api/reference/rest/v2/conferenceRecords.participants.participantSessions) resource for each session. If the _participant_ joins the same call multiple times from the same participant-device pair, they're each assigned unique session IDs.

### API Usage and Limits

#### Free Tier Usage:
Google Meet API usage is primarily tied to Google Calendar API usage limits, given that Google Meet events are created via calendar events:

- **Quota**: The free tier generally provides ample limits for typical usage scenarios.
- **Limits**: Detailed usage limits and quotas can be found on the Google Calendar API usage limits page.

### Working with the API

#### Common Operations:
- **Creating Events with Google Meet Links**: Utilize the `conferenceData.createRequest` field when creating calendar events.
- **Listing Events**: Use the `events.list` method to retrieve and manage events.
- **Updating and Deleting Events**: Utilize the `events.update` and `events.delete` methods to modify or remove events.

1. **Navigate to API & Services > Credentials**.
2. Click on **Create Credentials** and select **Service Account**.
3. **Download the credentials file** (JSON) and keep it safe.

### 2. Using the API with Libraries
#### a. Python Example with `google-cloud-speech`:
The `google-cloud-speech` library is the official client library for the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.

1. **Install the library**:
    `pip install google-cloud-speech`

2. **Authenticate and Transcribe Audio**:
```python
from google.cloud import speech from google.cloud.speech import enums from google.cloud.speech import types import io 
# Initialize the client 
client = speech.SpeechClient.from_service_account_json('path/to/credentials.json') # Load the audio file into memory with 
io.open('path/to/audiofile.wav', 'rb') as audio_file: content = audio_file.read() # Configure the request 
audio = types.RecognitionAudio(content=content) config = types.RecognitionConfig( encoding=enums.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16, sample_rate_hertz=16000, language_code='en-US' ) 
# Perform the transcription 
response = client.recognize(config=config, audio=audio) 
# Print the results 
for result in response.results: print('Transcript: {}'.format(result.alternatives[0].transcript))
```

### 3. API Usage and Limits

#### Free Tier Usage:
Google Cloud offers a free tier for the Speech-to-Text API:
- **Free Monthly Limit**: 60 minutes of audio.
- **Pricing Beyond Free Tier**: After exceeding the free tier, pricing is based on the duration of the audio processed. You can find detailed pricing information here.

### 4. Working with the API

#### Common Operations:
- **Transcribing Audio Files**: Using the `recognize` method for synchronous transcription of audio files.
- **Streaming Speech Recognition**: Using the `streamingRecognize` method for real-time transcription.
- **Handling Long Audio Files**: Using the `longRunningRecognize` method for processing long audio files asynchronously.
